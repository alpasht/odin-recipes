        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Couscous is a type of pasta, traditionally from North Africa, made from semolina flour (durum wheat) mixed with water. While it's often confused with a grain, it's actually a pasta, similar to rice in its use and appearance. It's a popular alternative to rice and pasta, and comes in different sizes, from small Moroccan couscous to larger pearl couscous.</p>


        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 tbsp olive oil </li>
          <li>1 small onion, finely chopped </li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped </li>
          <li>60g flaked almonds </li>
          <li>300g couscous </li>
          <li>450ml vegetable stock </li>
          <li>15g chopped coriander</li>
          <li>1/2 squeezed lemon </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps </h2>
          <ol>                    
          <li>Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. When the oil is hot, add onion, garlic and almonds. Fry until onions and garlic are softened, and almonds are golden and toasted, about 5 minutes. </li>
          <li> Add the couscous to the pan, and stir to combine. Pour in the stock. Cover the pan, turn off the heat, and leave for 5 minutes.</li>
          <li> After 5 minutes, remove the lid. Fluff up the couscous with a fork, then stir through the coriander and juice of half a lemon. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
