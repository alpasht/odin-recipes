        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Afghan mantu is a traditional dumpling dish made by filling thinly rolled dough squares with a seasoned mixture of ground beef or lamb, finely chopped onions, garlic, salt, pepper, and a touch of coriander. The dumplings are folded and sealed, then steamed until tender. They're typically served layered with a savory tomato-based sauce made from sautéed onions, garlic, and crushed tomatoes, and topped with a cool, tangy garlic yogurt sauce. A final garnish of dried mint or fresh herbs adds a burst of flavor, making mantu a deliciously balanced dish of savory, creamy, and aromatic elements. </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>In a bowl, mix 2 cups all-purpose flour with 1/2 tsp salt.</li>

          <li>Slowly add water (about 2/3 cup), kneading until a firm, smooth dough forms.</li>

          <li>Cover the dough with a cloth or plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>

          <li>In a bowl, mix 1 lb ground beef or lamb, 1 finely chopped onion, 2 minced garlic cloves, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, and 1/2 tsp ground coriander. </li>

          <li>Divide the rested dough into smaller portions and roll each one thin (like pasta).</li>

          <li>Cut the dough into 3-inch squares.</li>

          <li>Place a small spoonful of the meat filling in the center of each square.</li>

          <li>Fold and pinch the edges together to seal tightly (like a small pouch or dumpling).</li>

          <li>Lightly oil a steamer basket or line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li>

          <li>Place the mantu in the steamer, leaving space between each one and steam over boiling water for 30–40 minutes until fully cooked.</li>

          <li>In a pan, heat 1 tbsp oil and sauté 1 finely chopped onion until golden.</li>

          <li>Add 2 minced garlic cloves and stir for a minute.</li>

          <li>Pour in 1.5 cups crushed tomatoes, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp turmeric, and black pepper.</li>

          <li>Simmer the sauce on low for 10–15 minutes until thickened.</li>

          <li>In a bowl, mix 1 cup plain yogurt with 1–2 minced garlic cloves and a pinch of salt.</li>

          <li>Place steamed mantu on a serving platter. </li>
          <li>Spoon tomato sauce over the dumplings, drizzle garlic yogurt on top.</li>
          <li>Garnish with dried mint, fresh cilantro, or red chili flakes if desired. </li>
        </ol>
